# ServiceStack.Webhooks
Add Webhooks to your ServiceStack services

## [Release Notes](https://github.com/jezzsantos/ServiceStack.Webhooks/wiki/Release-Notes)

# Overview

This project makes it very easy to expose your own Webhooks to your ServiceStack services, and to manage your user's subscriptions to those webhooks.

By adding the `WebhookFeature` to the AppHost of your service, you automatically get all the pieces you need to raise and manage the events raised by your services. 

We _know_ that most services are built for scalability and to be hosted in the cloud, so we know that you are going to want to use your own components and technologies that fit in with your own architecture. Now you can, with the `WebhookFeature`.

For example: In one service, you may want to store the Webhook subscriptions in a _MongoDB database_, and have an _Azure worker role_ relay the events to subscribers from a (reliable) cloud _queue_.
In another service, you may want to store subscriptions in _Ormlite SQL database_, and relay events to subscribers directly from within the same service _on a background thread_, or throw the event to an _AWS lambda_ to process. Whatever works for you, the choice is yours.

_Oh, don't worry, we haven't left it all entirely up to you, just to get started with the `WebhookFeature`. We got your back with a built-in subscription store and built-in event sink that will get you going seeing how it all works. But eventually you'll want to swap those out for your own pieces that fit your architecture, which is easy._

If you cant find the component you want for your architecture (see [Plugins](https://github.com/jezzsantos/ServiceStack.Webhooks/wiki/Plugins)), it should be easy for you to build add your own and _just plug it in_.

# [Getting Started](https://github.com/jezzsantos/ServiceStack.Webhooks/wiki/Getting-Started)

Install from NuGet:
```
Install-Package ServiceStack.Webhooks
```

Simply add the `WebhookFeature` in your `AppHost.Configure()` method:

```
public override void Configure(Container container)
{
    // Add ValidationFeature and AuthFeature plugins first

    Plugins.Add(new WebhookFeature());
}
```

See [Getting Started](https://github.com/jezzsantos/ServiceStack.Webhooks/wiki/Getting-Started) for more details.

## Raising Events

To raise events from your own services, add the `IWebhooks` dependency to your service, and call: `IWebhooks.Publish<TDto>(string eventName, TDto data)`. As simple as this:

```
internal class HelloService : Service
{
    public IWebhooks Webhooks { get; set; }

    public HelloResponse Any(Hello request)
    {
        Webhooks.Publish("hello", new HelloEvent{ Text = "I said hello" });
    }
}
```

## Subscribing to Events

Subscribers to events raised by your services need to create a webhook subscription to those events.

They do this by POSTing something like the following, to your service:

```
POST /webhooks/subscriptions
{
    "name": "My Webhook",
    "events": ["hello", "goodbye"],
    "config": {
        "url": "http://myserver/api/incoming",
    }
}
```

## Consuming Events

To consume events, a subscriber needs to provide a public HTTP POST endpoint on the internet that would receive the POSTed webhook event. 

The URL to that endpoint is defined in the `config.url` of the subscription (above).

In the case of the "hello" event (raised above), the POSTed event sent to the subscriber's endpoint might look something like this:

```
POST http://myserver/hello HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
User-Agent: ServiceStack .NET Client 4.56
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate
X-Webhook-Delivery: 7a6224aad9c8400fb0a70b8a71262400
X-Webhook-Event: hello
Content-Type: application/json
Host: myserver
Content-Length: 26
Expect: 100-continue
Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive

{
    "Text": "I said hello"
}
```

To consume this event with a ServiceStack service, the subscriber would standup a public API like the one below, that could receive the 'Hello' event. That might have been raised from another service with a call to `Webhooks.Publish("hello", new HelloEvent{ Text = "I said hello" })`:

```
internal class MyService : Service
{
    public void Post(HelloDto request)
    {
        // They said hello!
        var message = request.Text;

       
        // The event name, messaging metadata are included in the headers
        var eventName = Request.Headers["X-Webhook-Event"];
        var deliveryId = Request.Headers["X-Webhook-Delivery"];
        var signature = Request.Headers["X-Hub-Signature"];
    }
}

[Route("/hello", "POST")]
public class HelloDto
{
    public string Text { get; set; }
}
```

Note: Webhook events can be delivered securely to subscribers using signatures, that proves the authenticity of the sender only. Delivered events are never encrypted, and only signed. See [Subscriber Security](https://github.com/jezzsantos/ServiceStack.Webhooks/wiki/Subscriber-Security) for more details.
